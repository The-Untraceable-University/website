      <p>
      In 2029 the Untraceable University aims to build a radical, new campus in a
      heavily degraded landscape, such as an abandoned mine. The teaching and
      practices of the university focus on enabling students, residents and staff to
      convert this landscape into a restored ecosystem in the decades that follow.
      The university itself aims to question existing social practices and norms, and
      develop new ones, as part of its restorative ambitions. The goal of this
      campus-city is to be of such a scale and ambition that it serves as inspiration
      and example for new practices in existing cities. <a href="mission/">Read more</a>

      <h2>Research</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-8 main">
      <p>
        As a precursor to this new campus, the Untraceable University Research
        Initiative brings together researchers, students, and practitioners
        from a wide variety of disciplines to validate, refine, and prepare the
        strategy for this unique campus-city. 

        Currently, the Untraceable University Research Initiative is building a consortium of partners, with
        a strong focus on participation from the Global South.
        Partners are sought in all disciplines that might be relevant to the physical, social, and ecological
        development of this campus, with a specific focus on people and organisations that look at
        alternative systems to enable sustainability transitions.
